This page describes the objectives and deliverables for the group projects, and lists some representative projects during the past decade’s classes.

Project Overview
----------------

The HST.921 Design Project is designed to provide students with hands-on experience tackling real-world healthcare IT challenges. The project topics are based on project submissions from students, faculty members, or corporate sponsors.

Project teams will be comprised of 3-5 students. An adjunct faculty member with extensive industry experience will act as a project mentor for each team.

Project Deliverables
--------------------

Each team will be required to deliver 3 mini presentations during tutorial sessions. One of these presentations will be an elevator pitch.

The final report must be a 10-15 page document, double-spaced. Each team will also deliver a final 30-minute presentation in class.
